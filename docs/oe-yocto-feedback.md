It is no secret that OpenEmbedded/Yocto has a steep learning curve. Many people
who try to use it get discouraged and write it off as porely done and impossible
to understand. This is one of the problems the motivated us to create Yoe.

Below is some of the feedback we've collected and links to various discussions.

- If a build breaks, it is not always obvious what went wrong. If there weren't
  Google, I'd be dead in the water!
- If I modify some code in a package, how do I know that a bitbake will properly
  pull in my changes and rebuild what I want it to? I'd expect that a simple
  bitbake would do what I'd think it should do, but in some cases, it does not.
