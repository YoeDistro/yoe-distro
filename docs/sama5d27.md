# ATSAMA5D27

The ATSAMA5D27 from Microchip is a ARM Cortex-A5 CPU available in 3 different packages:

- [IC](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMA5D27)
- [SIP package with embedded SDRAM](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMA5D27C-D1G)
- [SOM package](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMA5D27-SOM1)

Microchip also provides a [development board](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D27-SOM1-EK1).

## Building/installing an image

1. `git clone git://github.com/YoeDistro/yoe-distro.git`
1. `cd yoe-distro`
1. `. sama5d27-som1-ek-sd-envsetup.sh`
1. `yoe_setup`
1. `bitbake yoe-simple-image`
1. insert full size SD card (this image will not boot from the micro-sd slot)
1. `lsblk` (note sd card device, and substitute for /dev/sdX below)
1. `yoe_install_image /dev/sdX yoe-simple-image`
1. `sudo eject /dev/sdX`
1. Install SD card in development board and apply power via one of the micro-USB connectors.

## Connecting a serial console

The serial console for the development board is provided via the micro USB connector near
the Ethernet connector. The serial device will show up as /dev/ttyACMx on a Linux system.

## USB Host

USB Host is provided by connecting a port expander to the USB Type-C connector, as shown
in the photo above.

## Bootstrapping the system using SAM-BA

[SAM-BA](https://github.com/atmelcorp/sam-ba) is a boot assistant that can be used
to bootstrap a system over a UART or USB Client port and program fuses. It is possible
to bootstrap a system completely over SAM-BA with no flash/eMMC/SD memory
programmed. This is useful for systems that perhaps have a eMMC flash installed, but do
not have a SD card slot. To bootstrap such a system, we can:

- Load both the AT91Bootstrap and u-boot over a UART or USBClient port, and then
  boot into u-boot using SAM-BA.
- From u-boot, we can load a kernel from a USB flash device, or from a TFTP server
  over the network.
- The kernel can mount a root file system on a USB disk, or use the Yoe updater to
  initialize and program a SD/eMMC device.

This process has been automated and described in more detail below:

- build the target image first as described above
- `yoe_sam_build_bootstrap_tools` (this builds SAM-BA and a special version of the
  at91bootstrap that can be used to load the bootloaders.
- `yoe_sam_load_uboot_via_samba` (this loads at91bootstrap and u-boot over a UART. Note,
  you must stop u-boot from launching a kernel, because there is no kernel to launch.)
- `yoe_sam_install_bootstrap_files <USB disk mount point>` (this script copies the kernel
  and update file to a USB disk for installation)
- load a kernel from USB: `usb reset;fatls usb 0:1;fatload usb 0:1 0x21000000 at91-sama5d27_som1_ek.dtb;fatload usb 0:1 0x22000000 zImage;bootz 0x22000000 - 0x21000000`

At this point the kernel will boot, run the updater from an initramfs bundled with the kernel.
The updater will inialize a SD/eMMC device, and program the system from the \*.upd file on the
USB disk.

See the [Yoe Updater Documentation](updater.md) for more information on how the updater works.

You can also load a kernel from a TFTP server:

- `dhcp 0x21000000 <tftp server IP address>:at91-sama5d27_som1_ek.dtb`
- `dhcp 0x22000000 <tftp server IP address>:zImage`
- `bootz 0x22000000 - 0x21000000`
